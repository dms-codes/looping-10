# Number Pattern Generator

This Python script generates a simple number pattern based on user input `n`. It prints numbers in a right-aligned format, where each number is followed by a sequence of zeros.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

2. Enter an integer value `n` when prompted. This value determines the number of rows in the pattern.

3. The script will generate and display the number pattern in a right-aligned format.

## Example

For `n = 5`, the generated pattern will look like this:

```
 0 100000
 1 110000
 2 111000
 3 111100
 4 111110
 5 111111
```
